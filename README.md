# Salesforce CPQ Demo Project

A small, self-contained CPQ demo showing:
- A bundle with option constraints
- Price Rules (tiered discounts + region surcharge via Lookup Query)
- A Quote Calculator Plugin (QCP) that injects an Implementation Fee line and annotates line descriptions

**How to run:** Spin up Salesforce *CPQ-enabled* org (Developer Edition recommended). Can use with or without scratch org. 
Click-path is in `docs/click-path.md`.
